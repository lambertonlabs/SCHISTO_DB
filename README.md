All these instructions, at the moment, pertain to macOS.

Homebrew is needed to install PostgreSQL in this instance.
If you don't have Homebrew (https://brew.sh/), you should.
Paste into the terminal: 
```/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"```

To install PostgreSQL (the database system and language) and create the database, clone this repo to wherever you would like, cd into the directory and hit:

```bash install.sh```

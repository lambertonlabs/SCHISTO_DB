# SCHISTO_DB
# SCHISTO_DB: Install and build
A RDBMS for de-identifed SCHISTO_PERSIST data.

All these instructions, at the moment, pertain to macOS.

Homebrew is needed to install PostgreSQL in this instance.
If you don't have Homebrew (https://brew.sh/), you should.
Paste into the terminal: 
```/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"```

To install PostgreSQL (the database system and language) and create the database, clone this repo to wherever you would like, cd into the directory and hit:

```bash install.sh```

This only needs to be done once (unless you are having a purge), but subsequent steps should be repeated every time the DB gets updated.

Build the tables:

```bash builddb.sh```

You should recieve output to the prompt saying that your tables have been created. If you are rebuilding the DB, you will recieve output saying your existing tables have been dropped. At the moment, your data tables need to be kept in the 'data' directory. I am working on a way to scrape them from the Dropbox.

# Working with the database

The plan is for the database to be rebuilt every time there is a substantial change, and also at regular intervals

To work with the database, you can use postgres at the command line OR (recommended) use a postgres client

psequel (http://www.psequel.com/) is the client I use at the moment. Very basic but easy to use.

Download psequel. Log in using localhost, local username (echo $USER at the terminal), local password, and the database name (SCHISTO_PERSIST). See the postgres manual inc. in the repo, or check online for psql docs. I am planning on writing a file of 'stock' commands for interrogating the data.
